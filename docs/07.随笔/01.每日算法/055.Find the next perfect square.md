**题目：**
找出下一个完全平方数

**描述：**
You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

If the argument is itself not a perfect square then return either -1 or an empty value like None or null, depending on your language. You may assume the argument is non-negative.

Examples ( Input --> Output )
```
121 --> 144
625 --> 676
114 --> -1  #  because 114 is not a perfect square
```

```js
function findNextSquare(num){
    const sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(num)
    if (Number.isInteger(sqrtNum)) {
        return Math.pow(sqrtNum + 1, 2)
    }
    return  -1
}
```
